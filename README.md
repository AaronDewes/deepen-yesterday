# Nintendo Yesterday

This is a WIP app designed to archive the data inside the "Nintendo Today" app.
It is not affiliated with Nintendo in any way.

- `deepen-api` Contains generated API client code for Deepen/Aquavast/znsa
- `downloader` Generates the data dumps
- `db` Describes the database
- `api` Is a custom API server exposing the data I got here
- `web` A custom front-end for the data
- `docker-compose.yml` starts a Postgres instance and minio server for data storage. Useful for development.
